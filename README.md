# VHDL Window Slider

This window slider design is a reusable VHDL module that performs a sliding window operation over a stream of input pixel data. This module is commonly used in image and signal processing tasks such as convolution, filtering, and feature extraction in hardware accelerators (like FPGAs).

## Features

- Generic sliding window operation.
- Support for configurable window size, padding, stride, and frame dimensions.
- Streaming interface using AXI-Stream-like `tdata`, `tvalid`, and `tready` handshaking.
- Outputs windowed slices in column-major order.
- Works synchronously with a clock and reset.

## Functional Overview

The `window_slider` buffers input pixel data and extracts a sliding window (e.g., 5x5) from the full image or frame. It handles:

- **Input streaming**: Each clock cycle (when valid & ready), a pixel is fed in pixel-by-pixel.
- **Window buffering**: Internally stores rows and columns required to form each window.
- **Output formatting**: Outputs each column of the window as a single wide data word (`WINDOW_Y * DATA_WIDTH`).
- **Padding and stride**: Applies optional zero-padding and supports adjustable strides to control the overlap between windows.

## Future Work

- **Comprehensive Testbench**  
  Develop a thorough testbench suite that validates all major configurations, including:
  - Various window sizes (e.g., 3x3, 5x5, 7x7)
  - Different strides and padding values
  - Edge cases like partial windows or minimal frame sizes
  - Performance under high-throughput streaming

- **Simulation and Coverage Analysis**  
  Integrate with simulation tools (e.g., ModelSim, GHDL) to measure functional coverage and timing.

- **Visualization Tools**  
  Optional tools/scripts to visualize the sliding window operation using waveform viewers or image plots.
